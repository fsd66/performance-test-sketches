# String Building Results

This test shows that concatenating a string using the "+" operator is faster than joining an array.
I think this is not a surprising result, but good to know that string concatenation is actually not that expensive of an operation in Javascript.
There could be some underlying mechanism that I'm not aware of that could be producing a non-typical result, but I'll be satisfied with this for now.
