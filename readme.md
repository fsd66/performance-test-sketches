# Performance Test Sketches

This is a collection of tests I have written in order to compare or test the performance of various operations in Javascript.
I am far from an expert on Javascript performance, and definitely come from a place of ignorance on the matter,
but I like to think that I am learning at least *something* from these tests.

If the obviousness of some of these results makes you upset, then I can do little to alleviate your pain.

Additionally, many of these tests are written in haste, so don't be suprised if the code makes you want to gouge your eyes out.
